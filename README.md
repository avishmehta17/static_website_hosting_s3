This project demonstrates how to host a static website on **Amazon S3** while implementing secure **IAM-based access control**, following the Principle of Least Privilege.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- ✅ Hosted a **static website** using S3's static website hosting feature.
- ✅ Enforced **fine-grained access control** using **IAM policies and groups**.
- ✅ Ensured **upload-only** access for IAM users without delete permissions.
- ✅ Resolved common access issues like **403 Forbidden** and **404 Not Found**.
- ✅ Simulated and verified IAM permissions using the **AWS IAM Policy Simulator**.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **AWS S3** – Static website hosting, object storage, bucket configuration.
- **AWS IAM** – Role-based access control, policies, groups, and MFA.
- **AWS IAM Policy Simulator** – Validated custom IAM policy actions.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

### ✅ Amazon S3
- Static website hosting enabled with `index.html` as landing page.
- Bucket versioning and lifecycle policies explored.
- Public access configured (disabled block public access).
- Object-level metadata and unique key-based file storage.

### ✅ IAM Access Control
- Created custom IAM Policy (`S3-StaticWebsite-UploadPolicy`) allowing:
  - `ListAllMyBuckets`
  - `ListBucket`
  - `PutObject`
  - ❌ Denied `DeleteObject`
- Created IAM Group: `S3-StaticWebsite-Uploaders`
- Created IAM User: `amir` with **MFA enabled**, added to the group.

### ✅ Access Testing
Used **IAM Policy Simulator** to test:
- ✅ `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
- ✅ `s3:ListBucket`
- ✅ `s3:PutObject`
- ❌ `s3:DeleteObject` (denied by design)

## 🛡️ Security Practices

- Enforced **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for IAM user login.
- Followed the **Principle of Least Privilege** for all IAM roles and actions.

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Successfully deployed a static website on Amazon S3.
- Implemented secure and minimal access permissions using IAM.
- Ensured that sensitive operations like object deletion remain denied.
- Validated all actions through the AWS IAM Policy Simulator.
